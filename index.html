 <br><font color="gray"> Lewser. After becoming one, I didn’t feel like a “loser” although it sounded like it. Lewser is the fandom of Sean Lew stans. Sean Lew is a well-known dancer in Los Angeles, California. Aside from being a dancer, he is also a chef, singer, actor and a choreographer. So with all the talents he obtained, who would not admire him? Well, maybe it is easy for me to say it since he is a dancer and I am also fond of dancing. But the reason why I admire him is not only limited to that.

Sean Lew inspires me. He once said: <i>“It’s what you do in the dark that puts you in the light.” </i> Those words made me realize that if you believe you have the talent, never think twice on showing it. His positive personality encourages me to keep on doing what I like and keep on liking what I do. And now, it has been a year since the day I became a Lewser. In just a year, I have discovered so many things about myself. I have also made new friends because of Sean Lew.

But do you know what is the greatest thing I got from being a Lewser? Sean Lew taught me to stop focusing on how stressed my life is and to always remember how blessed I am.
